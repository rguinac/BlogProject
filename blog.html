        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 2</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">October 30, 2020 by <a href="#">Rudy Guinac</a></p>

        <p>This blog post is part of a project that is intended to show my progress using HTML, CSS, and JS. As of right now my skills are still rough but with more practice this webpage could be way more intuitive.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>So far the training process with TCS has been very insightful and has provided a great opportunity to continue to develop my coding skills. Thankfully for languages like HTML, we are taking it nice and slow.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>As of right now, I'm starting to get more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS but I still have <strong>a lot</strong> to learn.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm curious how learning TypeScript will be in Phase 2. Actually kinda curious how Phase 2 is gonna be like overall, but I'm ready to learn.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">October 27, 2020 by <a href="#">Rudy Guinac</a></p>

        <p>Well we have finished Phase 1 of the Simplilearn course and while I still have a lot to learn using HTML, CSS, and JS, I've learned quite a bit. One thing is for sure, I still got to study on my own time as well.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>One thing that I really liked about the Phase 1 portion of the course was having a bunch of examples that the teacher would work out so I can visually see how everything would work as they were being implemented.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Another aspect that I'm really happy about with course so far is that the teacher also uploads all the code from the sessions up on her Github so we can go back and refer to her code.</p>
        <p>This is so useful since I can go back and check to see her work. This allows me to work out any potential problem I ran across while initially working on it during the session and see what I did wrong and how to fix it.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Phase 1</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">October 19, 2020 by <a href="#">Rudy Guinac</a></p>

        <p>Today we started a whole new phase for the ILP training for TCS. The previous phase was more of a recap of how Java works, what you can do with it, and much more. It was great to be able to recap so much Java since the last time I
            worked with Java was back in my sophmore year of college.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Overall so far, I have enjoyed my time being at TCS and have enjoyed talking to a bunch of new people that have various backgrounds in coding. While I think my coding skills are kinda rusty in comparison, I'm still giving it all my effort.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I'm very curious how the next phase of the ILP training will go. We'll be working in a language that, while I do have some kind of knowledge, will be completely new to me.</p>
        <p>Hopefully this phase will be just as interesting and engaging as the last phase.</p>
